Dragonfly is an open source python library for scalable Bayesian optimisation.

Bayesian optimisation is used for optimising black-box functions whose evaluations are
usually expensive. Beyond vanilla optimisation techniques, Dragonfly provides an array of
tools to
scale up Bayesian optimisation to expensive large scale problems.
These include features/functionality that are especially suited for
high dimensional optimisation (optimising for a large number of variables),
parallel evaluations in synchronous or asynchronous settings (conducting multiple
evaluations in parallel), multi-fidelity optimisation (using cheap approximations
to speed up the optimisation process), and multi-objective optimisation (optimising
multiple functions simultaneously).

Dragonfly is compatible with Python2 (>= 2.7) and Python3 (>= 3.5) and has been tested
on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.
