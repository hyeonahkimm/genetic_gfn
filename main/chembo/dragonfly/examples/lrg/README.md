### Coming soon

An example of maximum likelihood estimation using data on Luminous Red Galaxies.

To run this demo, you will need to download the datasets and binaries from
[here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkandasa/dragonfly_datasets.html).
The binaries were compiled in Ubuntu and Springdale Linux, and might work only in a
compatible OS.

Then, run the following commands from this directory.
```bash
$ dragonfly-script.py --config config_lrg.json --options ../options_files/options_example.txt
```
