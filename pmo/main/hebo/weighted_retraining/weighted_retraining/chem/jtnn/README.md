# JTNN Sub-module

This is mostly copied from https://github.com/wengong-jin/icml18-jtnn.
Modifications have been made to:

- work in python3 instead of python2
- use the faster version of the code, but maintain backward compatibility with the original models
- work with pytorch lightning
- avoid some "bad" python usage such as `import *`
